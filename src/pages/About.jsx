        <p>If I can describe myself in one sentence, I’ll say that I am an advocate of doing things that make me feel alive.
        <p>Heyy fellow travel lovers !!</p>
        <p></p>I’m Sidharth and my intention here is to open your eyes to the magnificence of the planet that we have taken for granted.</p>
        <p>This is a memoir of my past adventures and a glimpse into the ones that await me in the future. My goal is to deliver not only the usual landscapes, portraits, and travel tips 
           but stories that can change your perception of the world. </p>
        <p>Welcome to Wandering Sid!!</p>
